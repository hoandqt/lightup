Michael's short film for \"Rock With You\" was the second of the three short films produced for recordings from that album. The single reached No. 1 in the United States in 1980, topping Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot R&B Singles charts and reaching No. 4 on Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 chart that same year.\r\n\r\n\"Rock With You\" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on February 14, 1980, and Platinum of February 14, 1989. The song was ranked No. 82 on Rolling Stone and MTV's list of the 100 Greatest Pop Songs in 2000. In his 1988 memoir Moonwalk, Michael called \"Rock With You,\" written by Rod Temperton, \"the sort of thing I was aiming for\" in creating an album to his vision.\r\n\r\nThe short film featured Michael performing the song on a plain stage in a sequined jumpsuit and matching boots, a set of shimmering lasers illuminating his outfit from behind. Director Bruce Gowers praised Michael as \"an absolute professional\" in an interview with Rolling Stone. In 2014, the magazine would rank \"Rock With You\" No. 6 on a list of Michael Jackson's 20 Greatest Videos.\r\n\r\nFollow the Official Michael Jackson Accounts: \r\nFacebook - http:\/\/smarturl.it\/mj_facebook?IQid=ytd.mj.rwy  \r\nTwitter - http:\/\/smarturl.it\/mj_twitter?IQid=ytd.mj.rwy  \r\nSpotify - http:\/\/smarturl.it\/mj_spotify?IQid=ytd.mj.rwy  \r\nNewsletter - http:\/\/smarturl.it\/mj_newsletter?IQid=ytd.mj.rwy  \r\nYouTube - http:\/\/smarturl.it\/mj_youtube?IQid=ytd.mj.rwy  \r\nWebsite - http:\/\/smarturl.it\/mj_website?IQid=ytd.mj.rwy",
