Its inclusion in the final scene of <em>The Sopranos<\/em> and performances in <em>Glee<\/em> helped introduce the song to new generations.<\/p>\r\n<p>The song's popularity surged again in the 2000s, demonstrating its lasting appeal and ability to unite people across different eras. Its inspirational message has made it a staple at weddings, graduations, and other milestone events.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Band's Enduring Influence<\/h3>\r\n<p>Journey's influence extends beyond \"Don't Stop Believin'.\" Their discography boasts numerous hits such as \"Any Way You Want It,\" \"Faithfully,\" \"Open Arms,\" and \"Wheel in the Sky.\" Each song showcases the band's talent for writing music that connects emotionally while pushing the boundaries of rock with innovative production and execution.<\/p>\r\n<p>The band's ability to evolve over the decades while staying connected to their musical roots is a testament to their artistry.
